		<p class="event-heading-even"> Brothers Endow Haines Scholarship at the 2015 Alumni Dinner </p>
		<p class="event-text"> During this years Alumni Dinner on February 22nd, our chapter announced the completion of endowment for the Michael Haines Scholarship. Haines was a fraternity brother of Phi Delta Theta at Robert Morris University. Mike was a victim of an armored truck heist in 2012, and the chapter has raised over $25,000 in just over two years to fund a scholarship that would be awarded in brother Haines name. "It's been a great recognition of Mike, but it has also been a great display of character on the part of the fraternity. It says a great deal about the young men who have worked so hard," Ann Haines, Michael's mother, said. Recipients of the scholarship must demonstrate the principles of the fraternity, friendship, sound learning, and rectitude.</p>
