		<h2 class="headingedgepadding">PARENTS</h2>
			<p class="edgepadding">Our parents support us in everything we do, this includes being a member of Phi Delta Theta. Our parents realize that being apart of Phi Delta Theta is not a pledge to a "frat" but to a fraternity of upstanding gentleman. We work everyday to become the greatest versions of ourselves and our parents notice that goal and encourage us on our passage. Parents are urged to reach out to the chapter if they have any concerns with a son joining in order to ensure support from all corners of a member during his four years at college. </p>
